node-emoji-random
=================

Creates a random emoji string. This is as useless as it gets.

## Install

```shell
npm install --save emoji-random
```

Or, globally, to use the CLI:

```shell
npm install -g emoji-random
```

## Use

```js
var emoji = require('emoji-random');

console.log(emoji.random());
```

Or, in your command line

```shell
$ emoji-random
```

Keep trying until you get an :octocat: `':octocat:'`.

Now with individual commits with each emoji!
